# Customer Messaging Study - under development
### Analysing and presenting 6 months of customer messaging data to answer the question - Do customers who message purchase items?

### This study was conducted in order to develop an automation strategy for an online business. 
---- 
### The Data was filtered to catergories of questions about - 
* Photos
* Price
* Miscellaneous item details 

## Key Insights and Outcomes
- Do customers who message purchase items? Generally - No
- 1 sale was made from 17 requests for extra photos (11 of these requests were replied to with attached photos)
- Most common messages received are related to price.

To improve business process - not sending extra photos was noted to be a strong area for automation. For efficiency, a stock reply could be issued stating that 'items are currently in storage but I would be happy to answer any questions you may have?'. With extra photos being sent taking roughly 30 minutes per item - this process at scale would be saving the business a lot of time. 

A total of 5 sales were made with replies to messages related to price, whereas 37 customers didn't proceed with the sale. In order to automate a customer reponse - further research would have to be conducted in order to see what made these 5 messages successful. A stock reply could be created in order to instruct customers that negotiations on price are made via the 'best offer' section rather than the message section.

## Further Developments 
Further Developments for this study would be to see the number of replies made by month and see how this relates to sales by month. 

Current findings:

- Replying to 65 out of 104 messages resulted in an 8% sale to message conversion rate. 

- The Number of sales made when no response was given to a question was 0

Incorporating into the visualisation below - No correlation can be drawn from the amount of replies to item sales. For this study to be developed in a futher investigation - all messages would need to be replied to.
